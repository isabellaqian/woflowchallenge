To test your ability to perform these tasks, we'd like you to write a small prototype application that implements a custom onboarding flow using Frigade (https://frigade.com/).
Create an app that use Frigade to create a custom onboarding flow that includes 3 different screens:
    A welcome screen
    A second screen that asks for user's name and email address
    A third screen that shows a thank you message, and any additional helpful message that may be relevant for the user experience
On the second screen, implement **simple validation** to ensure that the user has inputted a valid name and email address
    Some examples could be email should be in valid format, and validate name to be less than 255 characters, etc
Prototype or explain the necessary tests. This will need to handle the happy path as well as edge conditions.
Feel free to ask any clarifying questions, read the Frigade documentations (https://docs.frigade.com/overview/how-frigade-works), build on top of any app (such as https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/) or prototype your solution with appropriate amount of comments/explanation.

What we measure:
Understanding of the product requirements: does your solution address what's being asked?
Quality of the code: the ability to think through edge conditions, follow best coding practices as much as possible
Ability to read through documentations, if there's any assumption that needs to be made, please explain.
